# Project -1 National Park Geek 
Our team found very quickly, that our common interest was Hiking, Outdoors Activities and National Parks!! We wanted to make a website where
we were able to combine all of those interests into one easy application. We really enjoyed working with each other and really got a long great in building this project.

Our main focus was to build an application that combined all of the needs of the modern day hiker or park enthusiast.

We all took on roles that matched our abilities. Loren was look for a challenge with learning more jQuery and took on the back-end! Adam wanted more experience on the front-end since he's interested in front-end development roles. I decided to float on both front and back-end.

Adam worked quickly to give us a navigation bar and <div>'s to place Loren's dynamically built cards from the javascript file. I helped clean up front end work as well as kept the code neat and tidy. As we built code, I made sure each section had appropriate comments for sections within the html and js files.

Once Loren finished the dynamically built cards, she jumped in to help guide the front-end on design for the 'Contacts' and 'Weather' sections. 

I hooked in the secondary API calls for NPS Images and Weather.
